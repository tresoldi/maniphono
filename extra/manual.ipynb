    "  * a \"segment\" is a unit of analysis, as decided by the user; the most common\n",
    "    segment is, by far, a \"sound segment\", which is a segment composed of one\n",
    "    (monosonic segment) or more (polysonic segment) sounds\n",
    "  * a \"sequence\" is an ordered collection of segments and a set of information\n",
    "    on suprasegmental properties, such as syllable breaks, tones, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit is described in more detail in the subsequent sections. As as set\n",
    "of examples, however:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `model_mipa` is the standard phonological model in `maniphono`, comprised (at\n",

    "## PhonoModel\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a \"phonological model\" is composed of two main sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a feature definition\n",
    "  - a sound definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are defined in a tabular file named `model.csv` with contents similar to the snippet below:\n",
    "\n",
    "  | FEATURE    | FVALUE     | RANK | PREFIX | SUFFIX | CONSTRAINTS                    |\n",
    "  |------------|------------|------|--------|--------|--------------------------------|\n",
    "  | aspiration | aspirated  | 6    |        | ʰ      | consonant                      |\n",
    "  | centrality | back       | 2    |        | U+0320 | vowel                          |\n",
    "  | centrality | central    | 2    |        | U+0308 | vowel                          |\n",
    "  | centrality | front      | 2    |        | U+031F | vowel                          |\n",
    "  | centrality | near-back  | 2    |        |        | vowel                          |\n",
    "  | centrality | near-front | 2    |        |        | vowel                          |\n",
    "  | ejection   | ejective   | 5    |        |        | plosive\\|fricative\\|affricate  |\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important field for each row, and the only one that needs to be unique in the row, is the \"FVALUE\" one,\n",
    "as each row reports one \"fvalue\". The \"fvalue\" labels have names in all lower-case letters, with optional dashes,\n",
    "and must be unique across the entire model. There cannot be repeated fvalue names, even if they cannot apply to the\n",
    "same sound: as a consequence, for example, the MIPA model has a feature \"nasal\" which applies to consonants only,\n",
    "and a feature \"nasalized\" which applies to vowels only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"FEATURE\" column reports the feature in the model to which the fvalue refers to. Each sound in `maniphono`\n",
    "can have at most one fvalue per feature set, so that it is possible to ask questions such as \"which is fvalue\n",
    "for 'centrality' in sound X\" or \"is 'front' the fvalue for 'centrality' in sound Y\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\"RANK\", \"PREFIX\", and \"SUFFIX\" are properties mostly used for converting from and to graphemic representations,\n",
    "such as making sure that 'voiceless bilabial plosive consonant' is converted to \"p\". The first is an integer\n",
    "number that informs, in descending order, how \"important\" a value is, so that, when presenting information to the\n",
    "user, our results are reproducible and we always obtain 'voiceless bilabial plosive consonant' and not\n",
    "'voiceless bilabial consonant plosive' (which is, however, accepted as an input). Note that ranks are determined\n",
    "per fvalue and not per feature basis, as giving more fine-grained options about how to build the names. \"PREFIX\"\n",
    "and \"SUFFIX\" are, as expected, substrings that will attached to base graphemes in order to modify them; the order\n",
    "of addition follows the \"RANK\" property, so here as well the results are reproducible. Both \"PREFIX\" and \"SUFFIX\"\n",
    "can be given as Unicode charpoints. If an affix is needed when building a graphemic representation and it is\n",
    "not available, the library will fall back to adding the corresponding fvalue as a modifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"CONSTRAINTS\" is a non-mandatory field which allows a detailed specification of which fvalues must or must not\n",
    "be set for a given fvalue to be present in a sound. They can be used internally for a variety of purposes,\n",
    "such as making sure that sounds or groups of sounds considered impossible are not accepted (such \"sibilant laryngeals\",\n",
    "in the `mipa` model) and that some fvalues are automatically added when necessary (such as automatically marking\n",
    "all \"sibilants\" as \"fricatives\" in the same `mipa` model). The restriction that each can have at most one fvalue\n",
    "per feature can be interpreted as a list of constraints automatically added, where each fvalue implies the'\n",
    "absence of the fvalues of the same feature. The syntax for the \"CONSTRAINTS\" field can express many nuances\n",
    "and interdependencies, and is explained in subsection X.\n",
    "\n",

    "\"GRAPHEME\" is a base grapheme representation, and it is recommended that it follows\n",
    "the IPA as close as possible. As the \"PREFIX\" and \"AFFIX\" fields in model,\n",
    "this field accepts Unicode charpoints. Note, that internally the graphemes\n",
    "will always be normalized and returned following the NFD, that is, the\n",
    "Normalization Form Canonical Decomposition, when characters are decomposed by\n",
    "canonical equivalence, and multiple combining characters are arranged in a\n",
    "specific order. For more information, see subsection X.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"DESCRIPTION\" is a list of one or more fvalues that define the corresponding\n",
    "grapheme. It is not necessary for them to follow the ranks of the fvalues. While\n",
    "it is recommended to separate the fvalues by a single white space, there is some\n",
    "flexibility in terms of the syntax defining an \"fvalue list\" (see subsection X).\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"CLASS\" column reports a boolean information on whether the sound is partial\n",
    "(`True`) or not (`False`). Sound partiality is an attribute mostly used\n",
    "internally for forward and backward operation when applying a sound change,\n",
    "and for most common purposes the sounds that can be represented in IPA can be\n",
    "considered non-partial. It is recommended, following the practice in the\n",
    "literature, that partial sounds are defined with capital letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, there can be no duplicates in terms of graphemes (the same grapheme\n",
    "specified with two equivalent flists) and of fvalue lists (two equivalent\n",
    "flists mapping to different graphemes). The library will check for these\n",
    "restrictions when loading a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models can carry additional information related to each sound, both categorical\n",
    "(such as sound classes) and numerical (such as prosody values), which are not\n",
    "mandatory but might be needed by different methods and functionalities.\n",
    "In case this information is needed for a sound not in the list of sounds (such as\n",
    "one extended with a diacritic), the system will internally find the closest\n",
    "sound and repeat that information (this is what happens, for example, with\n",
    "sound classes). This also happens in case of empty cells (common, for\n",
    "example, for partial sounds).\n",
    "The MIPA model carries information on sound classes (derived\n",
    "from SCA [cite list]) and prosody (derived from [cite list]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound can be created from graphemes or from descriptions, which are lists\n",
    "of fvalues (provided either as a single string or as an actual Python\n",
    "iterable). All sounds have an implied model, which default to MIPA."
