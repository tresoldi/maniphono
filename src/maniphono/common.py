    each time.

    ----------
    grapheme : str

def parse_constraints(constraints: List[str]) -> list:
    """
    Parses a list of constraints into a constraint structure.

    The constraints are given as a list of strings, each string representing a
    constraint group. Each constraint group is a string with the constraints
    separated by the "|" character. Each constraint is a string with the name of
    the feature-value pair, preceded by a "+" if the feature-value pair must be
    present, or a "-" if it must be absent. If the constraint is not preceded by
    any of these characters, it is assumed to be a presence constraint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    constraints : Sequence
        The textual representation of the list of constraints to be parsed.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        The parsed constraints.

    This function is mostly used for parsing strings provided by the user,

    allow the same delimiters. Delimiters can be white spaces, commas, semicolons,
    forward slashes, and the " and " substring.

    ----------
