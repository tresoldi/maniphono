The central concepts of a model are "features" and "values". A feature is a set of one or more values that can be used to describe a sound or a group of
sounds (a "sound class"). For example, the "centrality" feature, used to describe the horizontal position of the tongue in vowel production
in the IPA, can take five different values: front, near-front, central, near-back, back. All values within the same feature are exclusive,
meaning that no bundle can be carry two or more values from the same feature; in most operations, applying a value from a feature that is
already set overrides the said value. For models derived from binary distinctive features, (discuss three-value), each feature feature will
usually have two values, corresponding to the presence or absence, such as feature "dorsal" with the potential values "-dorsal" (or "non-dorsal")
and "+dorsal" (or just "dorsal").

Value names are globally unique within a model, including those of different features. Valid names are.... Each value is associated with additional
properties that are used to manipulate and render sounds or bounds. Note that all these properties are related to values and not features,
meaning that different values of the same feature might have different weights, implications, etc. (even though in most cases all
values of the same feature will share weights and implications).

  - The weight specifies the "importance" of the value
in relation to other values. The definition is importance is loose and depends on the context, but in most cases it references to what takes
precedence when generating some output: for example, the most important feature in the IPA model is the type of the sound, meaning either a
consonant or a vowel, as correspondigly the generated English names will have the noun "vowel" or "consonant" at the end. Note that the weight
is inversely related to the importance: the lower the weight, the more important the value.

  - The implies lists the conditions for a value to be set, that is, which values must be present or are implied by another. For example,
  all value of feature "manner", the manner of articulation for consonants, such as plosive or trill, imply the feature "consonant" and
  cannot in the IPA model be applied to vowels. implies are not mandatory, and more than one might be listed, separating them with
  vertical bars (but nested ones are not allowed)

  - Prefix and suffix list the substring preceding and following a grapheme string so it can be modified; for example, in the IPA model, the
    feature aspiration has no prefix but a `Ê°` suffix, so that an "aspirated voiceless plosive consonant" ([p]) is rendered as the
    base sound listed [p] "voiceless plosive consonant" plus the suffix. Prefixes and suffixes are added to a grapheme string in
    order of their weight, defaulting to alphabetical value name in case of two or more values with the same weight (guaranteeing
    reproducibility). If a value lists no prefix or suffix, the information is added to the grapheme with a full list of the
    values between brackets; if we did not list one for aspiration, the "aspirated voiceless plosive consonant" would be rendered
    as "p[aspirated]" (this can of grapheme can be parsed by the system)
