This directory contains small models for testing purposes:

  - `a` is a valid small model
  - `b` is derived from `a` but has an invalid feature name
  - `c` is derived from `a` but has an invalid value name
  - `d` is derived from `a` but has duplicat value names
  - `e` is derived from `a` but has an invalid rank value
  - `f` is derived from `a` but has invalid value names in constraints
  - `g` is derived from `a` but has duplicate descriptions in sounds
  - `h` is derived from `a` but has invalid value names in sound descriptions
  - `i` is derived from `a` but has sound descriptions failing the contraints
